# input from user is by default a string
num1 = input("Enter 1st number: ")
num2 = input("Enter 2nd number: ")
# convert strings into numbers

# 1st way: use int, integer so only for whole numbers
# result = int(num1) + int(num2)

# 2nd way: float is a number that has a decimal
result = float(num1) + float(num2)

print(result)
